# Predictive Modelling and Analysis of Student Grades

## Overview
This project, authored by Arup Sarkar, focuses on harnessing data-driven insights in education. It aims to predict student grades using a comprehensive dataset from 107 students. The dataset includes performance in projects, quizzes, peer reviews, and final grades, alongside course logs.

## Introduction
The project explores the power of predictive modelling in an educational context. It aims to provide valuable insights into predicting grades based on academic performance and course engagement.

## Data Preprocessing
Key steps in data preprocessing include handling missing data, outliers, encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical features, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). This phase ensures accurate and robust predictive models.

## Data Analysis
The analysis employs statistical methods like correlation and heatmap visualization to understand relationships between academic performance metrics. It uses the Pearson correlation coefficient and visualizes correlations through heatmaps.

## Results and Conclusion
The project compared four models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree. Decision Tree showed the highest accuracy. The importance of avoiding biased features to prevent overfitting is emphasized.
